# toms-list
This is a simple repository to host the static content of Tom's 2024 Christmas List on a GitHub pages website.

The content of the list is maintained in the Markdown file <code>list.md</code>. The HTML file <code>index.html</code> leverages the <code>marked.js</code> JavaScript library (https://marked.js.org) to convert the Markdown to HTML on the fly. Some basic styling in <code>style.css</code> makes the webpage prettier.

Why not write the list directly in HTML in the first place? Well, the list will likely require frequent updates, and I would much rather edit a Markdown file on my phone than an HTML one.
